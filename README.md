# Hello_World

This is a simple test following the hello world tutorial
I don't really know how to use github, but hopefully this will 
help me organize myself and share my own code with those interested

If you find this relic later, feel free to criticize it, because
spelling and grammar are not my strong suit, given why I code

Goodbye!
